# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

We plan to create an app in which a user can add ingredients to a grocery list, those ingredients are then added 
as inventory into a database, and can be used to create meals/recipes. We will break those ingredients down by protein, 
carb, veg, etc. Once items are used, they are removed from the current inventory, which will also let the user know 
when items need to be replenished. Ideally, the user will never be without the full ingredients to make a meal, they 
will also know when it's time to go grocery shopping, and what items need to be purchased. There is nothing worse than 
having to make a grocery list, or deciding what's for dinner!

### Features

<li><b>User Login:</b> Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application, accessing their profile. 
They will be able to track their available ingredients, as well as possible meal prep combinations.</li>
<li><b>Search:</b> Users will be able to search available ingredients.</li>
<li><b>Add/Edit/Remove:</b> Users will be able to add/edit/remove ingredients from the inventory.</li>
<li><b>Ingredient Combinations:</b> App will track how many times an ingredient combination was used in a meal.</li>
</ul>

### Technologies

<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Spring Boot</li>
<li>Hibernate</li>

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn more about the account creation process, as well as login/validation. I will also look into Spring 
security. In addition, I want to learn more about how all of these different frameworks work together, I'm still trying 
to grasp these concepts. I will continue to expand my knowledge on concepts that we have already covered in this class 
as well.
